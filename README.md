# Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) algorithms development and validation
## Program for identifying OUDs in EMR data using different algorithms and validation of those algorithms.

We developed and validated OUD algorithms in four large academic healthcare systems including the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Duke, Wake Forest Baptist Health, and the Medical University of South Carolina. We used structured EHR data from 2014-2017 and used variables available in the PCORnet common data model to increase the generalizability of the algorithm. We also validated ICD 9/10 codes-based OUD definitions and compared their validity with that of our OUD algorithms.

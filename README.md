# Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) algorithms development and validation
Program for identifying OUDs in EMR data using different algorithms and validation of those algorithms.

We developed and validation OUD algorithms in four large academic healthcare systems including the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Duke, Wake Forest Baptist Health, and the Medical University of South Carolina. We used structured EHR data from 2014-2017 and used variables available in the PCORnet common data model to increase the generalizability of the algorithm. We also valdated ICD 9/10 codes based OUD definitions and compared their validity with that of our OUD algorithms.

Details on the algorithm development and validation can be found in:

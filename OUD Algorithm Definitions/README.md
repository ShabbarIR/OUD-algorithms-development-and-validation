_______________________________________________________________________

**Iteration** ------- **Criteria**
_______________________________________________________________________

V1		--------------	Any of: A, B, C, D, E

V2*	-------------  Any of: A, B, C, D, E

V3	  --------------  Any of: A, D, F, G, H

V4**	------------  Any of: A, D, F, G, I
________________________________________________________________________

A.	ICD9/10 codes for abuse/ dependence

B.	transition to buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone that were prescribed to treat OUD or co-prescription of Naloxone to prevent overdose

C.	≥50 MME of opioids for ≥180 days

D.	procedure codes for Medication Assisted Treatment for OUD

E.	≥1 overdose event during the study period

F.	≥90 MME of opioids for ≥180 days

G.	‘B’+’E’

H.	3+ ED visits with opioid RX in 30-day window 

I.	‘H,’ excluding ED visits where surgery was performed up to two weeks before visit

*iteration 2 had the same criteria as iteration 1, except that in iteration 2, we provided additional instructions to the expert adjudication panel that all abstraction should be restricted to the years 2014-2017 only.
